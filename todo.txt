Sim Finder Notes

Patchnotes v0.2.5:
    - Removed market watch (for now)
    - Added smo percentages (updates automatically)
    - Click on lot thumbnail to open new tab with the lot image blown up
    - Lookup sims using sim-id
    
Bugs:
    - Confetti animation is odd when spamming
    
v0.2.5 TODO:
    - Remove all URLs from functions.js
    - Hyperlinking sims/lots by url parameters
    - Re-sort sims by age, since cakes add days
    - Show count of how many sims are at the same job lot (out-of-range locations still match up)
    - Style editor
        - Either in-site or a new repo
        - GUI editor for custom styles
    - Hidden sims show up as being in lot, even when all sims at lot are accounted for
    - Bookmark list and lot list should fight for space, always reach max height if possible
    - New colors:
        - Royal purple (felt texture?)
        - Something special for New Years (stars?)

Low Priority TODO:
    - Refactor "CleanLink" function
    - Reduce bookmark lookups on page launch
        - Cache name/id pairs of bookmarked sims
    - Some functions are still out of place (constant refactor)
        - Move all GUI/writing functions to GUI etc
    - Clean up css (constant refactor)
        - Many scrambled and unused classes
    - Make easier to use on mobile
        - Layout is very large, could be much smaller
    - Refactor code to be modular per-tso server
        - eg. simply fill in api links to get it working elsewhere

Possible Features (Requires update to API):
    - Last-online date for sims/lots
    - Display sim's skills
    
Side Features:
    - Lot renderer/object finder
    - Music box creator
    - Improved roof art generator
    - DJ helper

Shelved Ideas:
    - Paid (Simoleons only, of course) features:
        - Just kinda dumb
    - Remove (Maybe Hosting) if all sims accounted for
        - Create possibility tree and figure this out
        - Since I've removed the privacy state from the sim panel, it might be better to keep it
